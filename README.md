# Discussion: UnixFS Specification

This repo is used to discuss and draft a specification for the next version of UnixFS (the DAG node format used to represent *files and directories* on the IPFS network). You can find and participate in discussion about desired features in [the issues](https://github.com/ipfs/ipld-unixfs/issues) and an [initial specification draft in PR #2](https://github.com/ipfs/ipld-unixfs/pull/2).

When the specification draft is complete, it will be moved to the `ipfs/specs` repo at https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/master/unixfs and this repo will likely be re-dedicated to building the **Go** implementation of UnixFS.
